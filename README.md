# Project Title: Optimizing Grocery Inventory Management for Gala Groceries

### Background:
#### Gala Groceries, a forward-thinking grocery store chain operating in the USA, has always embraced technology to gain a competitive edge in the market. Leveraging IoT and other cutting-edge technologies, they have built a strong presence in the industry. However, they recently encountered a significant supply chain challenge specific to the perishable nature of grocery items. Balancing inventory levels is crucial, as overstocking leads to excessive storage costs and waste, while understocking risks customer dissatisfaction and revenue loss

### Project Objective:
#### The primary objective of this project is to analyze their data to formulate key questions and provide actionable recommendations for more effective inventory stocking.

### Role: Data scientist

### Key Python libraries employed: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy.

### Key skills applied: Data modeling, feature engineering, data cleaning, data pre-processing, and data visualization.

### Machine Learning Model Used: Random Forest

## First step: Create a data model for the project

# Conclusion:
### We have successfully developed a machine learning model using Random Forest to predict stock requirements based on hourly data and weather conditions. This end-to-end project has equipped me with in-depth knowledge of Python libraries and various functions. While this machine learning model is not perfect, we recognize that there is room for improvement through further testing and the application of different techniques. Nevertheless, it represents a significant initial stride in the right direction. With continued effort, we can create an efficient model that will enhance Gala Groceries' revenue.
