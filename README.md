## Project Title: Optimizing Grocery Inventory Management for Gala Groceries

### Background:
#### Gala Groceries, a forward-thinking grocery store chain operating in the USA, has always embraced technology to gain a competitive edge in the market. Leveraging IoT and other cutting-edge technologies, they have built a strong presence in the industry. However, they recently encountered a significant supply chain challenge specific to the perishable nature of grocery items. Balancing inventory levels is crucial, as overstocking leads to excessive storage costs and waste, while understocking risks customer dissatisfaction and revenue loss

### Project Objective:
#### The primary objective of this project is to analyze their data to formulate key questions and provide actionable recommendations for more effective inventory stocking.

### Role: Data scientist
## First step: Create a data model for the project
